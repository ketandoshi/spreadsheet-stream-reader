Memory efficient spreadsheet reader. It reads file in streaming fashion. Currently supports Excel legacy file (.xls) format. Work in progress for other file formats.

You can configure the batch size. It will read and streams the batch size rows at a time.

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install spreadsheet_stream_reader

## Usage

#### Opening a spreadsheet

```ruby
require 'spreadsheet_stream_reader'

records_per_batch = 100 #By default its 1000. You will get this much records at a time.

document = SpreadsheetStreamReader::Reader.new('/path/to/workbook.xls', records_per_batch)
```

#### Working with sheets

```ruby
# Returns an array of names of sheets present in the workbook
document.sheet_names
# => ["K-Sheet-1", "K-Sheet-22"]


## Access the sheet
# By name
sheet1 = document.get_sheet('K-Sheet-1')
# By index
sheet2 = document.get_sheet(1)

# => Returns the SpreadsheetStreamReader::Sheet object
```

#### Iterate through single sheet

```ruby
sheet1.stream_rows_in_batch do |row|
  puts row #Work with the row data
end
```

#### Iterate through workbook (all sheets in workbook)

```ruby
document.each_sheet do |sheet|
  sheet.stream_rows_in_batch do |row|
    puts row #Work with the row data
  end
end
```
